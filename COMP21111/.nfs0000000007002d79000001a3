\section{Signed Formulae}

A signed formula is one where there is an expression, $A$ and a boolean $b$,
where $A = b$. If $A = b$ is {\it true}, in an interpretation $I$, then it is
denoted by $I \models A = b$, and consequently, $I$ is a model of the signed
formula $A = b$.

\marginpar{This is also when $I(A) =b$.}

If a signed formula has a model, then it is satisfiable.

\subsection{Finding a model of a satisfiable formula}

If we had a signed formula such as $A \Leftrightarrow B = 1$, the three
interpretations that model it are:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        A & B\\ \hline
        0 & 0\\
        0 & 1\\
        1 & 1\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Tabelau}

A tableau is a tree with each node being a signed formula. The tableau for the
signed formula $A = b$ would have the root node as $A = b$.

The notation for a set of branches is $B_1 | ... | B_n$, where each $B_i$ is a
branch.

\subsubsection{Branch expansions}

There are a number of rules that can be used to expand the branches of a
tabelau.
