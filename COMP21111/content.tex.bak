\section{Signed Formula}

A signed formula is one where there is an expression, $A$ and a boolean $b$,
where $A = b$. If $A = b$ is {\it true}, in an interpretation $I$, then it is
denoted by $I \models A = b$, and concequently, $I$ is a model of the signed
formula $A = b$.

\marginpar{This is also when $I(A) =b$.}

If a signed formula has a model, then it is satisfiable.

\subsection{Finding a model of a satisfiable formula}

If we had a signed formula such as $A \implies B = 1$, the three interpretations
that model it are:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}
        A & B\\ \hline
        0 & 0\\
        0 & 1\\
        1 & 1\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
