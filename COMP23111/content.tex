\section{An introduction to Database Management Systems}

DataBase Management Systems (DBMS's) are a type of middleware that provide a
layer of abstraction for dealing with databases. It is nearly always unnecarry
to write software from scratch that interfaces with a database, since a lot of
database operations will share a significant amount of logic.

Henceforth, a lot of the functionality required of applications that make use of
a database is placed into a DBMS, which application developers can make use and
save time. The DBMS acts as a service, that is well implemented and is able to
enforce good practices and advanced techniques such as concurrency, sharding,
recovery management and transactions.
