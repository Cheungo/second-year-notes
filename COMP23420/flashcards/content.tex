The answer is Add client record, which is a typical use case with the format of verb-direct  - object-noun .  Add (verb-direct) Client Record (object-noun).\\

    2. & Incorrect. This is a condition on how customer data should be treated. not a function itself. The correct Answer is Customer can add an item to their basket as this is a sensible basic functionality you could expect of an e-commerce system.\\
    3. & Incorrect. If it was just Must be able to print Address labels It could be seen as a functional requirement However, it is a condition on this, that the labels should be on sticky paper.  The correct answer is Customer can add an item to their basket as this is a sensible basic functionality you could expect of an e-commerce system.\\
    4. & Incorrect. it is a preference on how pictures of products should be displayed. Remember the car anaology, the car colour made no effect what so ever of the its functional requirements.
