In a Banking System, which of these would you consider a non-functional requirement?
Cash withdraws should be possible 24/7
Customer can withdraw Cash
Customer can transfer money to another account
Customer can close their account
Correct. This is how something should be done, not what should be done.



This is a condition on how the cash withdraws functional requirement should be down.The other three are functional requirements.
