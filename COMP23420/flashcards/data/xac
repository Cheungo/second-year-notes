Which of these requirements for a hotel booking system is the odd one out?
A customer should be able to manage their bookings
A customer can book a room up to 12 months in advance.
A customer can cancel a room booking.
A customer can amend a booking.
Correct. The level of abstraction is higher than the others. It is very general and can include many other things.  The others are of a more fine granualarity and refer to more specific requirements
