In an Aircraft system which of the following is the odd one out?
The warning lights for the pilot should be red and flash
There must be a warning light when fuel is low
A warning light must indicate if the cabin door is not shut properly
Pilot should be able to disable a warning light
Correct. This is a non-functional requirement, as it says how the function of the warning light should behave. The others are all functional requirements
