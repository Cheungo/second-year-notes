In a flight booking database system, what would be a non-functional requirement?
The booking database should be backed up every 5 minutes
A new booking should be added to the database
A cancelled booking can be deleted from the database
A particular booking information can be read from the database
Correct. this is more of a safety requirement and not a actual functional requirement. The others are actual functions on the database
