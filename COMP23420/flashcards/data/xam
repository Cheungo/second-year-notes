Imagine a Hotel Management System, which would be a good example of a functional requirement?
A room can be reserved for a customer.
The database should have enough storage for 10,000 customer records.
The system should have the latest anti-virus software installed.
Each room should be described clearly on the hotel website.
Correct. This is basic functional requirement with nothing about how it should do it. The others have some description properties of the system or how functions should be performed.
