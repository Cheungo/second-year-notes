In the hairdressing analogy, which would be a non-functional requirement?
The chair height should set high
hair must be cut short round the back
hair must be cut short round the sides
Don't cut too much off the top.
Correct. This does not effect the function of the hair being cut. The others are specific to the function of cutting hair
