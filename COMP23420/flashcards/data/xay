 How does Craig Larman describe use cases?
Things you say youre doing when the boss shows up
Things you do when the boss is away
Things the boss asks you to do
Things the boss does
Correct.  Things you say youre doing when the boss shows up, so hes basically saying use cases are things the boss would expect you to be doing. Example:  Boss: What are you doing?  You: Printing accounts.  Use case format:  Printing (direct-verb) accounts (object-noun)
