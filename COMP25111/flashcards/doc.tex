	What three steps occur during the fetch phase?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.32\textwidth}{l X}
		1. & Use PC as address to read memory\\
		2. & Save result of read in CPU\\

\card{
	What control signals do all registers need?
}{
	An enable signal
}

\card{
	What control signal does a multiplexer need?
}{
	A signal to select an input
}

\card{
	What control signals does the memory need?
}{
	Ren (read enable) and Wen (write enable)
}

\card{
	Which 3 signals control the ALU?
}{
	add, sub \& byp
}

\card{
	What is a process?
}{
	A program in execution, the thread + address space.
}

\card{
	What is the address space?
}{
	All memory locations the process can use.
}

\card{
	What is a thread?
}{
	A sequence of instructions that are obeyed.
}

\card{
	What is multi-threading?
}{
	This is where we have multiple threads within the same process
}

\card{
	How do we make programs think they have sole use of memory?
}{
	Use \textbf{relocation}, where we swap a program out of memory and later swap it back in.
}

\card{
	What are the three different approaches to engineering an OS?
}{
	Monolithic, layered and micro-kernels.
}

\card{
	What are the three process states?
}{
	Running, ready, blocked
}

\card{
	In the diagram, what is happening at each stage?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.32\textwidth}{l X}
		1. & Process need to wait for I/O or event.\\
		2. & Process forcibly preempted - \textbf{interrupt / relinquish CPU / time-slice expired}.\\
		3. & Scheduler selects process to run.\\
		4. & I/O or event occurs.\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is a PCB table?
}{
	Process control block, it contains all of the information needed about processes.
}

\card{
	In scheduling, what do the following mean?
	\begin{tabularx}{0.32\textwidth}{l X}
		1. & CPU burst\\
		2. & I/O burst\\
		3. & CPU bound\\
		4. & I/O bound\\
	\end{tabularx}
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.32\textwidth}{l X}
		1. & Process executing on CPU\\
		2. & Process blocked, waiting for I/O\\
		3. & Long CPU bursts\\
		4. & Short CPU bursts\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is a processes turnaround time?
}{
	The time from a process being submitted to it getting completed.
}

\card{
	What is a processes waiting time?
}{
	The time that the process waits to run.
}
