\section{Question 1}

\subsection{Part a}

\lstinputlisting[language=Java, firstline=2, lastline=12, caption={
	Add all of the pairs of integers together in the list. Do this by looping
	through the list, and looping from 0$\rightarrow$currentIndex on each
	iteration.
}]{code/part1a.java}

Since as we're iterating through the list, we are describing an arithetic series
(we do one additions, then two, then three etc), we can use the formula
$\frac{n(1+n)}{2}$ to find how many operations we're doing. This, in the Big-Oh
notation, equates to $O(n^2)$ since constant terms are eliminated. In most
cases, the result will be found significantly faster though.
