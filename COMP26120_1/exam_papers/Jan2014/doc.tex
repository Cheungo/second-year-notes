	\small Please don't assume these answers are right. This is me attempting a
	past paper for revision purposes; I could have got it all wrong ;)

  I chose to answer questions 1 \& 2.
\end{center}

\section*{Question 1}

\subsection*{Part a}

\lstinputlisting[language=Java, firstline=2, lastline=12, caption={
	Add all of the pairs of integers together in the list. Do this by looping
	through the list, and looping from 0$\rightarrow$i on each
	iteration.
}]{code/part1a.java}

Since as we're iterating through the list, we are describing an arithmetic series
(we do one additions, then two, then three etc), we can use the formula
$\frac{n(1+n)}{2}$ to find how many operations we're doing. This, in the Big-Oh
notation, equates to $O(n^2)$ since constant terms are eliminated. In most
cases, the result will be found significantly faster though.

\subsection*{Part b}

\lstinputlisting[language=Java, firstline=2, lastline=11, caption={
	Add the first list to a BitSet (a very compact array of bits), then iterate
	through the second list and add items that are in the bit set to the output
	array.
}]{code/part2a.java}

The worst case runtime of this algorithm is $O(n + m)$ since it iterates through
both arrays once, and the loops aren't nested.

\newpage

\subsection*{Part c}

\lstinputlisting[language=Java, firstline=5, lastline=15, caption={
	Create a new array containing the first half, and a new array containing the
	second half, then replace them insert them into the original array.
}]{code/part3a.java}

The worst case runtime of this function is $O(n)$, since it only iterates
through the array once. The space complexity is $O(2n)$, since I couldn't figure
out how to do an in-place circular shift.

\section*{Question 2}

\subsection*{Part a}

\subsubsection*{i)}

Merge Sort

\subsubsection*{ii)}

Quick Sort

\subsubsection*{iii)}

Radix Sort

\subsection*{Part b}

\subsubsection*{i)}

It never ends.

\subsubsection*{ii)}

The average time that the smallest element will take to reach it's correct
position is $n \cdot n$, since we need one die roll to be 0, and the other to be
the current index of the smallest element, and there is a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance
of both occurring, so there is a $\frac{1}{n^2}$ chance of them occurring on the
same iteration.

In order for all of the $n$ items in the list to settle into their current
position in the list, we need the above to happen $n$ times, so we end up with
an average running time of $n \cdot n \cdot n = O(n^3)$.

\subsection*{iii)}

If every roll of the dice happened to be a valid swap, and the first roll was
swapping the smallest element with the element at position $0$, the second roll
was swapping the next smallest element with the one at position $1$, and so on,
then after $O(n)$ iterations, the list would be sorted.

\subsection*{Part c}

\subsubsection*{i)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $x > y$ and $y > z$ then $x > z$ (transitivity).
  \item If $x > y$ and $y > x$ if and only if $x = y$ (anti-symmetry).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{ii)}

The notation for lower bound is big omega ($\Omega$).

Comparison based sorts must at have a runtime of at least $n \log n$, therefore
their asymptotic running time is $\Omega(n \log n)$.

\subsubsection*{iii)}

The reason that comparison based sorts must be $\Omega(n \log n)$ is that they
sorting algorithms must satisfy the transitivity condition.

Comparison sorts basically just traverse a decision tree of comparisons of
elements in the list. The tree can have at most $n!$ leaves (since that's how
many permutations of a list of length $n$ there are). An optimally balanced
decision tree with $n!$ leaves would be $\log_2(n!)$ levels deep. This means we
have to do at most $\log_2(n!)$ comparisons, and by Stirling's approximation:

\begin{align*}
  \Omega(\log_2(n!)) \approx \Omega(\log_2(n!))
\end{align*}
