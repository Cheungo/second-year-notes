\section{Distributed computing}

A distributed system is a computing platform build with many computers that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Operate concurrently,
  \item Are physically distributed (and can fail independantly)
  \item Are linked by a network
  \item Have independent clocks
\end{itemize}

Leslie Lamport once said that:

%TODO: Quote thing

You know you have a distributed system when the crash of a computer you've never
heard of stops you from getting work done.

Distributed systems have evolved from sinple systems in the 70's and 80's. Early
systems were for banks and airline booking systems, but the real proliferation
of the technique arose with the internet in the early 90's.
